== Aida-americas import into Drupal

This is a simple Rails application -- really just a few rake tasks
along with Active Record models -- to help import data from my own
home-grown CMS into Drupal.

It might be useful to use my ActiveRecord objects for Drupal.

I also reverse-engineered some of the database changes for bilingual
websites, and you may be able to see that better with the code rather
that making changes to a working Drupal system and then figuring out
what happened to the database.
